# Create a Microsoft Graph client

The Microsoft Graph client is designed to make it simple to make calls to Microsoft Graph. You can use a single client instance for the lifetime of the application. For information about how to add and install the Microsoft Graph client package into your project, see  [Install the SDK](sdk-installation.md).

The following code examples show how to create an instance of a Microsoft Graph client with an authentication provider in the supported languages. The authentication provider will handle acquiring access tokens for the application. Many different authentication providers are available for each language and platform. The different authentication providers support different client scenarios. For details about which provider and options are appropriate for your scenario, see [Choose an Authentication Provider](choose-authentication-providers.md).

```php
// PHP client currently doesn't have an authentication provider. You will need to handle
// getting an access token. The following example demonstrates the client credential
// OAuth flow and assumes that an administrator has consented to the application.
$guzzle = new \GuzzleHttp\Client();
$url = 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/' . $tenantId . '/oauth2/token?api-version=1.0';
$token = json_decode($guzzle->post($url, [
    'form_params' => [
        'client_id' => $clientId,

$accessToken = $token->access_token;

// Create a new Graph client.
$graph = new Graph();
$graph->setAccessToken($accessToken);

// Make a call to /me Graph resource.
$user = $graph->createRequest("GET", "/me")
